Using Python and PyGame, the aim of this application is to shoot down as many asteroid as possible before its fuel runs out and obtain the highest possible score.
The game data such as fuel, score, and speed can be found in the config.py file and the functions to track these asteroids are located in the player.py file.
The example_tests.py file contains the different testcases for the application to run through.
